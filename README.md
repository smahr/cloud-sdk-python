# SAP Cloud SDK for Python

## About this project

This SDK provides consistent interfaces for interacting with foundational services such as object storage, destination management, audit logging, telemetry, and secure credential handling.

The Python SDK offers a clean, type-safe API following Python best practices while maintaining compatibility with the SAP Application Foundation ecosystem.

### Key Features

- **Agent Decorators**
- **Agent Gateway**
- **Agent Memory**
- **AI Core Integration**
- **Audit Log Service**
- **Audit Log NG**
- **Destination Service**
- **Document Management Service**
- **Extensibility**
- **IAS (Identity and Access Service)**
- **ObjectStore Service**
- **Secret Resolver**
- **Telemetry & Observability**

## Requirements and Setup

- **Python**: 3.11 or higher

### Installation

#### uv

```bash
uv add sap-cloud-sdk
```

#### Poetry

```bash
poetry add sap-cloud-sdk
```

#### pip

```bash
pip install sap-cloud-sdk
```

### Environment Configuration

The SDK automatically resolves configuration from multiple sources with the following priority:

1. **Kubernetes-mounted secrets**: `$SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT/<module>/<instance>/<field>`
   - `SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` defaults to `/etc/secrets/appfnd` when not set (follows the [servicebinding.io](https://servicebinding.io/spec/core/1.1.0/) spec). See the [Secret Resolver guide](../core/secret_resolver/user-guide.md) for details.

2. **Environment variables**: `CLOUD_SDK_CFG_<MODULE>_<INSTANCE>_<FIELD>`
   - For instance names, hyphens (`"-"`) are replaced with underscores (`"_"`) for compatibility with system environment variables.
   - You can see examples in our [env_integration_tests.example](.env_integration_tests.example)
